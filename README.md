# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome on my GitHub page :grinning:

:woman_technologist: I am currently studying sotfware engineering at [42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-5eLloP79wIVhJBoCR1VEwNIEAAYASAAEgKuovD_BwE) which is part of a [world wide network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/).

The 42's curriculum challenges the traditional learning model and provide an industry-leading education. Thus in order to educate the next generation of software engineers.

--> For more information, please refer to my [42_cursus](https://github.com/Sndrn/42_cursus) repository.

:compass: I am also exploring diverse programming languages and technologies on my own. 

ðŸ’» My current goal is to deepen my knowledge in software engineering.
